        <h1>The Gospel of Errol</h1>
        <p>A graphical and biblical analysis of <br>
        <br>
        Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</p>
        <p class="intro" style="display: block;">The lion tamer, the gardener, the roboticist, and the molerat specialist; each of these men are like a god to the respective entities they control. These four men each embody an aspect of the god of the old testament. The lion tamer embodies the wrath of God, the gardener embodies God the creator of life; the roboticist, God the creator of spirit and the molerat specialist, the curious God who watches man’s peculiar behavior.<br>
        If we are to assume these men are like God, that would make the entities they control analagous to man. Man strives to be like a God and have control. Despite this he is inevitably controlled by forces outside his comprehension. Like the lion confounded by the four legged chair, like the robots programmed to do what is in their nature; man in fact has very little control over his own destiny. To compensate for the insecurities this raises, we endeavor to control tameable entities such as molerats and trees.</p>

        <h1>CURIOSITY</h1>
        <p>“It’s this incredible mammal that breaks the rules.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 3:11 Hast thou eaten of that tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I said: “yes,” joyfully. So that’s how it started.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 1:31 And behold, it was very good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I was invited to design an exhibit.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 2:15 And the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to dress it and keep it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“You can design a burrow and think that the mole rat’s going to do great in it and have the animal perform in a totally different way.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“They went right at it and started fighting. So obviously there had to be something that seperated them, a language.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I know you are, you know I am”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“All their creature comforts are connected with that cage. They don’t particularly want to leave it. They don’t really consider themselves caged.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I look at them strictly from the point of self-knowledge, of learning not only about them but about myself and the way that they act and re-act towards each other.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“When things are slow, they chirp for me.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“I actually moved with my vermin to make sure that they would always be with me, wherever I go.”</p>

        <div id="mind" class="box">
        <h1>CREATOR OF MIND</h1>
        <p>“I switch it on and it does what is in its nature.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>
        <p>
        Almost immediately after being created by God, humans act on their own by eating the forbidden fruit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        “This is a way of building your own baby, if you like… understanding life by building something that is life like.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        “you’ll say: “Open,” and it will open.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        “Together, they performed some global task, much bigger than the sum of their parts.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        “Synthesize a set of rules.”</p>
        <p class="bible">EXO 20:13 Thou shalt not kill.<br>
        Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>
        Thou shalt not steal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“This approach to building robots will eventually lead to robots as intelligent as human beings.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“The next step in human evolution”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Higher level intelligence, whatever that is, is pretty easy once you have the ability to move around, hunt, chase.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Consciousness is put there by God, so that he has a very quick interface to find out what we’re thinking about.”</p>
        </div>
        <div id="body" class="box">
        <h1>CREATOR OF BODY</h1>
        <p>“You know what an animal looks like, and so you just start making an animal.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“It’s beautiful. But don’t leave that man up there all by himself. He has to have a lady there. Can you make a lady?”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“Don’t bother to dress it.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 2:11 And he said, Whold told thee that thou wast naked?</p>
        <p>Adam and Eve are created naked, and clothed after the fact.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“You’re old fashioned. You want to do everything by hand.”</p>
        <p class="bible">GEN 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="wrath" class="box">
        <h1>WRATH</h1>
        <p>“They say it’s taboo or something.”</p>
        <p class="bible">34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</p>
        <p>
        Clyde Beatty battles winged heathens who worship pagan gods.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“He was an idol”</p>
        <p>Clyde Beatty is given godlike status.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        “I learned by trial and error. I made some very serious errors too, believe me.”</p>
        <p class="bible">5:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</p>
        <p class="bible">EXO 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</p>
        <p>God makes and acknowledges several mistakes throughout biblical times. God creates humanity twice, and again nearly wipes all humans out with the flood.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        “You put the chair up, and all of the sudden, he has four points of interest. He loses his original train of thought because this agitates him. He can’t comprehend those four points of interest. You try to keep the animal afraid of you in that he does not understand you.”</p>
        <p class="bible">EZE 1:5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings… </p>
        <p>The cherubim have a very strange appearance that is confounding to man. God’s motives and nature are beyond human comprehension.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        “There are always a couple of them scheming to do something.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        “Now, thunder doesn’t bother them. An electrical storm does bother them.”</p>
        <p class="bible">EXO 20:18 and the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.</p>

        The girl we have working now, she’s young and doing a very good job, but she has a lot to learn. She has all young animals. They’re growing up together and, hopefully, they’ll both learn something.</p>
